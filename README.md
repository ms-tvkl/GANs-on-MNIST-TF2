# GANs-on-MNIST-TF2

This repository provides a comprehensive Experiment on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), focusing on building, training, and extending various GAN architectures using TensorFlow/Keras on the MNIST dataset. It's designed for both beginners and those looking to deepen their understanding of different GAN types.
## Features

-   Implement DCGAN: Learn to build and train a foundational Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) architecture from scratch.
-   Log and Visualize Training: Monitor GAN training progress effectively through loss curves and periodically generated sample images.
-   Extend to Conditional GAN (cGAN): Explore how to condition GAN generation on input labels to produce specific types of images (e.g., digits).
-   Extend to Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP): Implement a more stable GAN variant that addresses common training issues by optimizing the Earth Mover's distance and enforcing a Lipschitz constraint.

## Technologies Used

-   Python
-   TensorFlow 2.x
-   Keras
-   NumPy
-   Matplotlib
